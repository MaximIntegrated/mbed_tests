# MBED Functinal Tests for Maxim Targets

You can build the project with all supported [Mbed OS build tools](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/latest/tools/index.html). However, this example project specifically refers to the command-line interface tool [Arm Mbed CLI](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-cli#installing-mbed-cli).
(Note: To see a rendered example you can import into the Arm Online Compiler, please see our [import quick start](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/latest/quick-start/online-with-the-online-compiler.html#importing-the-code).)

1. [Install Mbed CLI](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/latest/quick-start/offline-with-mbed-cli.html).
1. From the command-line, import the example: `mbed import mbed_tests`
1. Change the current directory to where the project was imported.

## Application functionality
The repository include multiple test cases, the expected test case should be selected before building. 
To select test open main.cpp file and set to 1 the test you would like to build.

## Building and running


    
To deploy mbed:
    ```bash
    $ mbed deploy
    ```
    
To build mbed_tests project:
    ```bash
    $ mbed compile -m MAX32660EVSYS -t <TOOLCHAIN>
    ```

Your PC may take a few minutes to compile your code.

The binary is located at `./BUILD/<TARGET>/<TOOLCHAIN>/mbed_tests.bin`.

Alternatively, you can manually copy the binary to the board, which you mount on the host computer over USB.

Depending on the target, you can build the example project with the `GCC_ARM`, `ARM` or `IAR` toolchain. After installing Arm Mbed CLI, run the command below to determine which toolchain supports your target:

```bash
$ mbed compile -S
```
